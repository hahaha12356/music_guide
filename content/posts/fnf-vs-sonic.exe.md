## Introduction
If you are looking for the most comprehensive **FNF Sonic.EXE Guide** on the web, you’ve probably realized by now that this isn't just a standard mod—it is a piece of gaming history wrapped in a labyrinth of code. I remember when the original 2.0 update dropped; the community collectively lost its mind over the sheer quality and the cryptic secrets hidden behind the "Sound Test" menu. Even now, in late 2025, with all the fan restorations and "Rerun" updates, navigating the secrets of the executable can be confusing for newcomers. Whether you are trying to unlock Majin Sonic or figure out why Lord X is draining your health, I’ve broken down the technical steps to ensure you see every ending without crashing your PC.

## Why This Mod Refuses to Die
Let’s look at the technical impact here. Before *Vs. Sonic.EXE*, creepypasta mods were usually low-effort jumpscare fests. This mod changed the meta. It introduced complex mechanics like the "Pendulum" mechanic in *Cycles*, strict health drain in *Triple Trouble*, and distinct art styles for every version of the hedgehog (from the pixelated 16-bit Sunky to the hand-drawn horror of Xenophanes). The music, composed by MarStarBro and others, transcends the genre—tracks like "Endless" aren't just difficult charts; they are genuine bangers that utilize Sega Genesis soundfonts perfectly. It holds a legendary status because it respects the source material while pushing the Friday Night Funkin' engine to its absolute limit.

## The Ultimate List: Unlocking The Secrets

Since the official mod was cancelled and subsequently "Restored" by the community, accessing the content requires specific knowledge of the Sound Test menu. Here is the technical breakdown of how to access the hidden content.

### 1. Accessing the Sound Test Menu
You can't just scroll to these songs in Freeplay initially. You have to earn them.
*   **The Method:** In the Main Menu, you need to unlock the Sound Test option. In most builds (2.5/3.0 Restored), this appears after beating the main "Story Mode" week.
*   **The Input:** Once inside the Sound Test, you will see two numbers: PCM NO. and DA NO. You need to adjust these numbers to specific values to trigger the events.

### 2. The PCM Codes (The Keys to the Kingdom)
Here are the essential coordinate pairs you need to input. Once the numbers are set, press ENTER to inject the code.

*   **PCM 12, DA 25 -> Unlock "Endless" (Majin Sonic)**
    *   *Veteran Note:* This is the fan-favorite. The chart is an endurance test. It’s not about complex patterns, it’s about infinite repetition. The gimmick here is the "Majin" font notes. If you see a note with a face, hit it.
*   **PCM 7, DA 7 -> Unlock "Cycles" (Lord X)**
    *   *Veteran Note:* This unlocks the Lord X fight. Mechanics are key here. Watch out for the static notes; hitting them penalizes your accuracy heavily.
*   **PCM 31, DA 13 -> Unlock "Too Fest" (Sanic)**
    *   *Veteran Note:* A meme song, but the chart speed is deceptively fast. It’s a good warmup for your trilling speed.
*   **PCM 0, DA 0 -> The Jumpscare**
    *   *Veteran Note:* Classic legacy easter egg. It doesn't unlock a song, but if you want the authentic creepypasta experience, give it a try.

### 3. Surviving "Triple Trouble" (The Marathon)
This is the 8-minute opus of the mod. It cycles through Tails, Knuckles, Eggman, and Xenophanes.
*   **The Strategy:** Pacing is everything. Do not burn your stamina on the Tails section; it's the easiest. The difficulty spikes massively during the Eggman section due to the awkward charting rhythm. Keep your eye on the health bar drain; you cannot afford to miss notes during the Xenophanes transitions.

## Pro Tips for Listeners & Players
Having played through every iteration of this mod since the initial demo, here are some technical tips to save you from frustration.
1.  **FPS Optimization:** *Vs. Sonic.EXE* is asset-heavy. The visual shaders (static, blood, glitches) can cause frame drops even on decent rigs. If you notice stuttering during "Triple Trouble," go into the Options menu and disable "Shaders" and "Flashing Lights." Stable FPS is more important than visual flair when you're trying to hit 20 NPS (Notes Per Second).
2.  **The "Static Note" Mechanic:** In songs involving Lord X or the new 2025 fan expansions, you will see notes that look like TV static. **Do not hit them.** Unlike normal notes where missing hurts you, touching these will drain your health. It requires rewriting your muscle memory to *ignore* inputs, which is harder than it sounds.
3.  **Download the Right Build:** Be careful where you download. The "Official" mod is dead. You want to look for "Vs. Sonic.EXE: Restored" or "The Rerun" on GameBanana. These are the community-patched versions that fix the memory leaks from the original 2.0 build.

## FAQ

**Q: Is the Sonic.EXE mod officially cancelled?**
**A:** Yes, the original dev team disbanded years ago due to internal drama. However, the community took over. The "Restored" versions you play in 2025 are fan-made patches that finished the incomplete content left in the source code.

**Q: How do I fight Sunky (Milk)?**
**A:** Sunky is the joke character. In the Restored build, playing the song "Sunky" is usually unlocked by default in Freeplay, or by beating the main week. He doesn't have a kill mechanic—he just wants to offer you cereal. It’s a break from the horror.

**Q: Why does my game crash after the "Too Slow" song?**
**A:** This is a legacy bug related to how the game handles cutscenes on certain graphics cards. Try running the game in "Windowed Mode" rather than Fullscreen, or update your Kade Engine/Psych Engine version if you are playing a standalone port.
