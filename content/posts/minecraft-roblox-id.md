## Introduction
If you are currently scouring the library for a working **Minecraft Roblox ID**, you are likely trying to recapture a very specific type of nostalgia that modern games just fail to deliver. I’ve been analyzing game audio since the early 2010s, and there is frankly nothing that hits quite like C418’s minimalist piano compositions. Whether you are constructing a massive base in *Theme Park Tycoon 2* or just want a calming background track for a showcase, these assets are essential. The problem, as many of you know, is the volatility of the Roblox audio marketplace in 2025. Finding high-quality, uncorrupted uploads of these tracks is a chore. I’ve done the legwork to verify which codes are actually functional so you can focus on building rather than searching.

## Why C418's Soundscapes Are Timeless
It isn't just about the memes; it’s about audio engineering. C418 (Daniel Rosenfeld) and later Lena Raine created soundtracks that are designed to be "felt" rather than just heard. In the context of Roblox, these tracks serve a crucial technical purpose: they are non-intrusive. Unlike the loud, compressed EDM tracks often used in simulators, songs like "Sweden" or "Wet Hands" sit perfectly in the mix, allowing sound effects (like building sounds or UI clicks) to remain audible. This dynamic range makes them the objective best choice for "Tycoon" games or "Obbys" where player concentration is key. They provide atmosphere without inducing ear fatigue, a balance few Roblox composers manage to strike.

### Editor's Picks: Technical Breakdown

### 1. Sweden
**ID: 1845554017**
This is the quintessential track. From a technical standpoint, the slow tempo (around 60 BPM) makes it ideal for "Showcase" games or waiting lobbies. It loops reasonably well, though the fade-out on most Roblox uploads can be a bit abrupt. If you are developing a game that requires players to stay in one area for a long time (like a cafe or a drawing game), this is the most non-offensive, high-retention audio choice you can make.

### 2. Pigstep
**ID: 5472648784**
Lena Raine changed the meta with this one. Unlike C418's ambient work, "Pigstep" has a distinct, driving beat that leans into hip-hop territory. This works surprisingly well for "Speed Run" obbys or moderately paced platformers. It has enough energy to keep the player moving but lacks the high-frequency screeching found in typical Roblox speedcore tracks. A solid choice for active gameplay.

### 3. Stal
**ID: 5253604328**
Look, Jschlatt hates it, but from an audio design perspective, "Stal" is unique. The recorder melody is sharp and cuts through other noises. I recommend using this specifically for "Trolling" items or comedic effect in roleplay servers. It has a "goofy" quality that immediately signals to other players that you aren't taking the situation seriously. It’s a niche tool, but effective in the right hands.

## Pro Tips for Audio Implementation
If you want these tracks to sound correct in your game environment, pay attention to these parameters.
1.  **Volume Normalization:** Minecraft music is mastered much quieter than standard Roblox audio. If you are using a boombox script, you might need to crank the `Volume` property to 2 or 3 (standard is 0.5) to make "Subwoofer Lullaby" audible over footstep sounds.
2.  **The "Private" Asset Strategy:** As of the 2025 updates, Roblox allows monthly free audio uploads. Since C418's music is heavily copyrighted and public codes often get taken down, the "Pro" move is to download the MP3 yourself and upload it as a **Private Asset**. This ensures 100% uptime for your game or profile, as private assets aren't subject to the same aggressive copyright bots as public marketplace items.
3.  **Looping seamlessly:** Most "Sweden" uploads include the long silence at the end. If you are a developer, script a check to restart the sound *before* the silence hits, or find a "looped" edit on the marketplace. Dead air kills immersion.

## FAQ

**Q: Why do my Minecraft codes keep stopping?**
**A:** It is almost certainly a copyright takedown. C418’s publisher and Microsoft protect their IP. If a Public code goes dead, check the marketplace for a newer upload or use the Private Asset method I mentioned above.

**Q: Can I use these in a monetized Roblox game?**
**A:** Technically, no. Using unlicensed copyrighted music in a game that generates Robux (and thus real money via DevEx) puts you at risk of a DMCA strike. Use "Minecraft-inspired" royalty-free tracks if you are building a serious commercial project.

**Q: Where is the disc 11 or 13 ID?**
**A:** I generally don't list those because they are just unsettling noise. However, they exist on the platform. Search for "Creepy Cave Noise" or "Broken Disc" if you really want to scare people in a horror game, but they aren't great for casual listening.
