Yo, Robloxians! What's good?

Let’s be real for a second—grinding in *Brookhaven*, hanging out in *Da Hood*, or just flexing your fit in *Catalog Avatar Creator* is absolutely dead without the right soundtrack. Silence is the enemy of the vibe.

We all know TikTok drives the meta right now. Whether it's those sped-up remixes that scratch your brain just right or the absolute bangers dominating your For You Page, you need that heat in your Boombox. But there is nothing—and I mean *nothing*—more annoying than typing in a code just to see "Content Deleted."

I’ve done the heavy lifting for you. I’ve scoured the library to find the freshest, working IDs for the tracks everyone is using right now. Get your Boombox ready, because here are the top picks for 2025.

### 🔥 Top 10 Trending TikTok Song IDs

Here is the curated list of the absolute best tracks to blast right now.

### 🎧 How to Use These Roblox Music IDs

If you're new to the Boombox game or just need a refresher, here is how you get the music playing:

1.  **Equip Your Boombox:** Launch your game of choice (like *Brookhaven RP* or *MM2*) and equip your Boombox or Radio item.
2.  **Open the Interface:** Click on the Boombox/Radio while your character is holding it. A GUI window should pop up asking for a "Sound ID."
3.  **Enter the Code:** Copy one of the IDs from the table above (Ctrl+C) and paste it into the box (Ctrl+V).
4.  **Hit Play:** Smash that enter/play button and let the server hear what real taste sounds like.
