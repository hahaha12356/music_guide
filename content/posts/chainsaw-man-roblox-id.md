## Introduction
Finding a working **Chainsaw Man Roblox ID** in 2025 is a literal nightmare because of the constant audio wipes, but I've got you covered with the absolute HEAT today! I know exactly how it feels when you're trying to flex your devil-hunting skills in *Blox Fruits* or *Anime Roulette* and your radio is just dead silence—it totally kills the vibe, right? We’ve spent hours scouring the library and testing these codes to make sure you get that main character energy the second you hit play. Stop settling for mid background music and let’s get into the goated tracks that will make your lobby look like a high-budget MAPPA production!

## Why Kick Back is Literally Peak Fiction
"Kick Back" by Kenshi Yonezu isn't just a song; it’s a whole lifestyle at this point. The second that bassline drops, your adrenaline levels go through the roof. It blew up on TikTok for a reason—that chaotic, messy, and high-energy vibe fits the *Chainsaw Man* world perfectly. Whether you're grinding levels or getting ready for a massive boss raid, this track turns a boring gaming session into a cinematic masterpiece. It’s got that "I’m about to lose my mind and I love it" energy that every Roblox player needs when things get sweaty. If you aren't playing this while revving your virtual saws, you're doing it wrong!

### 1. Kick Back (Opening Theme)
This is the GOAT. Period. The energy is absolutely insane. I recommend playing this in any fast-paced PvP game. When that "DORYA!" hits, your click speed legit doubles—no cap. It’s the perfect hype-up song for when you’re about to jump into a 1v1 and need to intimidate everyone in the server.

### 2. Hawatari Nioku Centi (Ending 3)
Bro, this track is straight-up unhinged. If you like heavy metal and chaotic transitions, this is your new obsession. It’s perfect for chaotic games like *Natural Disaster Survival* or *Combat Warriors*. It makes everything feel 10x more intense and slightly terrifying, which is exactly the vibe Denji would want.

### 3. Fight Song (Ending 12)
Looking for something a bit more melodic but still keeps that fire energy? Eve never misses. This song is literal perfection for those "chill but cool" vibes. It’s great for hanging out in *Brookhaven* or just exploring new maps while looking like a total legend. It’s a bop that everyone in the chat will start asking for the ID for.

## Troubleshooting Your Radio Vibe
Don't let a "0" volume or a bad ID ruin your day. First thing’s first: **DO NOT copy-paste spaces!** If you accidentally include a space at the start of the code, Roblox will act like it doesn't exist, and you'll be standing there like a noob with a silent boombox. 

Also, legit warning: some of these tracks, especially the Maximum the Hormone ones, are mastered way louder than others. If you don't want to blow out your eardrums (or your viewers' ears if you're streaming), start your radio volume at like 2 or 3 and work your way up. Finally, if a code stops working, it’s probably the copyright bots being annoying. Just refresh this page, and we’ll have the newest re-uploads ready for you!

## FAQ

**Q: Why does my Chainsaw Man Roblox ID keep getting muted?**
**A:** Copyright is a beast, literally. Big labels love to nuke these IDs. When that happens, the audio gets replaced with "silence." Just grab a new ID from our list—we keep things updated so you don't have to worry!

**Q: Can everyone hear my music in-game?**
**A:** Usually, yes! As long as you have the Boombox gamepass or the game provides a radio, anyone near you will hear your fire taste in music. Just don't be that guy who spams it in the lobby too hard.

**Q: How do I get a free Boombox?**
**A:** Most big games charge Robux for the Boombox, but some "Catalog" or "Hangout" maps give them to you for free just for joining. Check the game's description before you drop those Robux!
