## Introduction
Listen, if you don't have a working **K-Pop Roblox ID** loaded into your boombox right now, are you even a real stan? I am literally obsessed with the current state of music on Roblox. There is nothing—and I mean *nothing*—more satisfying than syncing a perfect choreography emote in *TTD 3* while blasting "Pink Venom" at max volume. Whether you are leading an Army battalion in a roleplay server or just vibing with fellow Blinks in a showcase, having the right soundtrack is essential. I’ve been scouring the library (so you don't have to) to find the IDs that haven't been nuked by copyright yet. Get your lightsticks ready, because this list is absolute FIRE.

## The Hallyu Wave Took Over Roblox
Why is K-Pop the meta in 2025? Because the energy is unmatched! You cannot tell me you don't feel like the main character when a Blackpink beat drop hits. K-Pop isn't just music; it's a whole aesthetic. It fits perfectly with the high-energy, colorful, customized world of Roblox avatars. We see it everywhere—from the intricate dance cover groups hosting concerts in private servers to random players in *Catalog Avatar Creator* styling their idols. The beat drops are harder, the production is crisper, and honestly, nothing trolls a lobby full of "dark and edgy" players better than blasting "Pop!" by Nayeon. It’s a cultural reset, every single time.

### Editor's Picks: Absolute Bangers Only

### 1. Pink Venom - BLACKPINK
**ID: 1056483921**
THIS. SONG. IS. GOATED. I don't care what anyone says, when that intro starts chanting "Blackpink," the whole server knows what's up. It’s perfect for combat games or strutting down the runway in *Fashion Famous*. The bass hits so hard it literally shakes the screen. 10/10, no notes, absolute queen behavior.

### 2. Dynamite - BTS
**ID: 5632840912**
Okay, it's a classic, but it's a classic for a reason! It’s impossible to be in a bad mood when this plays. I use this when I'm trying to diffuse a fight or just chill in *Brookhaven*. It’s pure serotonin. If you play this and nobody dances, leave the server immediately. You don't need that kind of negativity in your life.

### 3. God's Menu - Stray Kids
**ID: 5410086218**
"DU DU DU DU DU DU." That’s it. That’s the review. If you want to feel like a boss, this is the track. It’s chaotic, it’s loud, and it goes unbelievably hard in PvP games. Walking into a boss fight with Felix’s deep voice on the track? Instant win. I’m literally obsessed with how hype this makes me feel.

## How to Stan Harder (Pro Tips)
Don't let your vibe get ruined by technical difficulties. Here is how to keep the concert going.
1.  **Pitch-Shift is Your Bestie:** Roblox copyright bots are ruthless with K-Pop labels (looking at you, YG and HYBE). If a standard ID dies, search for "Nightcore" or "Pitch Corrected" versions. They sound a bit like chipmunks, but at least the audio plays!
2.  **Layering for the Win:** Want to create a chaotic fan chant effect? Get two friends to buy radios and play the same song ID at the same time. The echo makes it sound like a stadium concert. It’s insane.
3.  **Check the Duration:** Some "K-Pop IDs" are just 10-second TikTok loops. Before you flex your radio, make sure you aren't looping the intro 500 times. Test it in a private server first so you don't look like a noob.

## FAQ

**Q: Why do K-Pop codes get deleted so fast?**
**A:** Because the record labels do not play around! K-Pop copyright strikes are faster than light. If a code on this list stops working, it’s because the copyright bots found it. We try to update, but it’s a constant battle.

**Q: Are there full versions of these songs?**
**A:** Rarely. Most Roblox audio is capped at 2 minutes or shorter to save upload costs. You usually get the first verse and chorus, which let’s be real, is the best part anyway for a dance emote.

**Q: Can I request a specific group?**
**A:** You can try uploading your own audio file on the Roblox website! It costs a bit of Robux, but then you have your bias in your inventory forever (unless it gets banned, RIP).
