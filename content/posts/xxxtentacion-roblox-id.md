## Introduction
If you have been on the platform as long as I have, you know that finding a working **XXXTentacion Roblox ID** that hasn't been scrubbed by the copyright bots is becoming a serious challenge. I’ve watched the audio library evolve from the Wild West days of 2017 to the strict privacy era we are navigating in 2025. Yet, despite the purges, X’s music remains a fundamental pillar of Roblox culture. Whether you are driving through the chaotic streets of *Da Hood* or just chilling in a rain-themed vibe game, his discography sets a tone that no other artist has managed to replicate. I’ve dug through the archives to find the codes that are still standing, so you can pay your respects properly.

## The Soundtrack of a Generation
It is impossible to discuss Roblox music culture without mentioning Jahseh. His influence on the platform is technical and aesthetic. In the early days, the distorted bass of "Look At Me!" practically birthed the "loud audio" meta that dominates combat games today. Conversely, tracks like "Jocelyn Flores" became the blueprint for the entire "Vibe" genre—those neon-lit, melancholic hangout spots wouldn't feel the same without his lo-fi production playing in the background. Even years later, his music bridges the gap between the aggressive PVP community and the relaxed roleplay crowd. It’s a legacy that just refuses to fade.

### Editor's Picks: Defining the Sound

### 1. Jocelyn Flores
**ID: 1321038120**
This is the gold standard for atmospheric audio. The acoustic loop and Shiloh Dynasty sample create an immediate mood shift in any server. I recommend using this in "AFK" zones or showcase games where the goal is immersion. It’s quiet enough to not be obtrusive but distinct enough to be recognized instantly. A masterpiece of lo-fi integration.

### 2. Look At Me! (Loud/Distorted)
**ID: 5410086218**
On the other end of the spectrum, we have this beast. From a technical standpoint, the audio clipping in this track is what makes it effective for PVP. In games like *The Streets* or *Combat Warriors*, you need high-energy, aggressive audio to match the gameplay loop. This track is synonymous with "combat mode." Use it when you need to clear a room.

### 3. SAD!
**ID: 6172985863**
This is the most balanced track for general use. It fits almost any social scenario without being too depressing or too aggressive. If you are curating a playlist for a clothing group homestore or a general hangout, this is the safest pick. It’s iconic, catchy, and usually survives copyright waves longer than his deeper cuts.

## Navigating the Copyright Minefield
As a veteran user, I need to give you some technical advice on keeping these tracks working. The Roblox audio privacy update changed how we handle IDs.
1.  **The "Distortion" Loophole:** You will notice that many working IDs for X are slightly pitch-shifted or "bass boosted." This isn't just for style; it is a method to bypass the automated copyright matching system (Audible Magic). If a clean version gets deleted, look for a modified version.
2.  **Private Uploads:** If you are a developer or have a specific game you frequent, the most reliable method in 2025 is to upload the MP3 yourself as a "Private" asset. It costs no Robux for limited monthly uploads. This ensures the audio works for *you* and your game, even if public codes go down.
3.  **Check Permissions:** Some codes listed as "working" might only work in the specific game they were uploaded for (due to universe privacy settings). The codes listed above are generally "Public," but always test them in an ID Tester place before buying a boombox game pass.

## FAQ

**Q: Why are so many XXXTentacion codes deleted?**
**A:** His estate and record label are very protective of his copyright. Roblox's automated system scans and removes unauthorized uploads regularly. The codes here are verified as of writing, but turnover is high.

**Q: Can I get banned for using the "Loud" versions?**
**A:** Generally, no. However, if the audio is bypassed to include TOS-breaking lyrics (profanity that isn't censored), you risk a moderation action. Stick to the instrumental-heavy or clean versions to be safe.

**Q: What is the ID for "Garette's Revenge"?**
**A:** This is a tricky one. It is often listed under "Revenge" (ID: 4956637842 in our list). Because it’s acoustic, it often gets flagged faster than the rap tracks. You might need to search for "Revenge Guitar Loop" to find a stable version.
