## Introduction
If you are currently hunting for a working **FNAF Roblox ID**, you definitely have a death wish—or you just really love purple men. Look, we’ve all been there. You’re chilling in *Brookhaven*, and suddenly the urge to transform into a malfunctioning animatronic and blast the "Toreador March" becomes overwhelming. It’s not just a game; it’s a lifestyle. In 2025, the FNAF brainrot is still real, and frankly, I’m here for it. But finding codes that haven’t been stuffed into a suit and deleted by Roblox moderation is harder than 50/20 mode on Ultimate Custom Night. I’ve dug through the vents to find the audio codes that are actually working so you can bring the pizzeria vibes to any server.

## The Man Behind the Meme
Why is this music still so popular? Two words: The Internet. The Living Tombstone didn't just make songs; they made anthems for a generation raised on jumpscares. And let's not forget the memes. Whether it’s the "Man Behind The Slaughter" beat drop that took over TikTok or the absolutely cursed "Freddy Fazbear Beatbox," these sounds are iconic. They are perfect for trolling in horror games, setting the mood in roleplay servers, or just confusing people who have no idea why a bear is singing about biting the frontal lobe of a child. It’s chaotic, it’s loud, and it’s exactly what Roblox needs.

### Editor's Picks: The Cringe & The Cool

### 1. It's Been So Long (The Man Behind the Slaughter)
**ID: 193716374**
*Clap-clap.* If you play this, you are legally required to turn your avatar purple. This song is the holy grail of FNAF memes. It’s perfect for when you want to act mysterious in the corner of the room or just annoy people with that infectious beat drop. It invokes a primal fear in anyone who was on the internet in 2020. 10/10 for psychological warfare.

### 2. Freddy Fazbear Beatbox
**ID: 6486253457**
Har har har har har. Listen, I don't make the rules, but this audio is objectively hilarious. It’s so bad it’s good. Walking up to a random player in *Da Hood* and blasting this directly into their face is a top-tier experience. It confuses the noobs and delights the veterans. Use responsibly (or don't).

### 3. Join Us For A Bite
**ID: 506466046**
This one is for the TikTok dancers. It’s surprisingly catchy for a song about animatronics wanting to eat you. It has a high-energy pop vibe that fits weirdly well in upbeat games like *Fashion Famous* or *TTD 3*. Just ignore the lyrics about human souls and enjoy the groove.

## How to Survive the Night (And Copyright Bots)
Before you run off to terrorize the night guard, read these tips so your boombox doesn't turn into a useless brick.
1.  **The Pitch-Shift Survival Strat:** The Living Tombstone is very protective of their copyright (fair enough). If the original IDs above stop working, search for "Nightcore" or "Slowed" versions. The altered pitch often slips past the Roblox auto-detection bots. It sounds like Alvin and the Chipmunks are possessed, but hey, it works.
2.  **Jumpscare Warning:** If you are using sound effects like the "Golden Freddy Scream," for the love of pizza, lower your volume. You want to scare people, not give them actual tinnitus. Roblox admins can ban you for "disruptive audio" if you’re just blowing out speakers.
3.  **Don't Get Scammed:** There is no such thing as a "Robux Generator" that plays FNAF music. I don't know who needs to hear this, but stop clicking those links in the chat. Just use the codes.

## FAQ

**Q: Why do my FNAF codes keep getting deleted?**
**A:** Because William Afton always comes back, but copyright strikes are forever. Roblox purges licensed music regularly. If a code dies, check back here or look for "Cover" versions by different artists.

**Q: What is the ID for the "Har Har Har" song?**
**A:** That is the "Freddy Fazbear Beatbox" or sometimes the "Toreador March." Check the table above. It’s the sound of pure brainrot.

**Q: Can I use these in my own Roblox game?**
**A:** If you are a developer, be careful. Using copyrighted music like TLT in a monetized game is a risk. You might want to upload a cover version or use royalty-free spooky music to avoid your game getting a strike.
