## Introduction
If you are searching for a working **Undertale Roblox ID**, you are filled with *Determination*... and probably a desire to annoy everyone in the server. Look, we all know the drill. You don't just "play" Undertale music; you weaponize it. There is a specific kind of fear that strikes a *Roblox BedWars* lobby when they hear the first four notes of "Megalovania." It’s the universal signal that someone is about to get dunked on. Whether you are roleplaying as a lazy skeleton or just want the grooviest background music ever composed by a dog (Toby Fox is a legend), I’ve gathered the codes that are still surviving the Roblox audio purge. Let's get into the spaghetti.

## Why Toby Fox Owns Our Braincells
It’s actually scary how good this soundtrack is. Even in 2025, a decade after the game dropped, tracks like "Death by Glamour" and "Spider Dance" are still trending on TikTok and YouTube Shorts. Why? Because they are absolute bops that fit literally any situation. Fighting a boss? "Megalovania." Eating a sandwich? "Bonetrousle." Having an existential crisis? "Fallen Down." In the Roblox ecosystem, Undertale music is the ultimate meme fuel. It’s recognizable instantly, it’s high energy, and it pairs perfectly with those cursed blocky avatars doing the default dance. It’s not just music; it’s culture.

### Editor's Picks: The Meme Lord's Choice

### 1. Megalovania (Original)
**ID: 1845554017**
Do I even need to explain this? It’s the meme holy grail. If you walk into a PVP game and you aren't playing this, are you even trying to win? It psychologically damages your opponents. It tells them, "I have spent way too much time on the internet, and I am about to ruin your day." Essential for any inventory.

### 2. Temmie Village
**ID: 1846667234**
hOI! i'm tEMMIE! This song is pure brain rot in audio form. I love blasting this in serious roleplay servers just to watch the chaos unfold. The goofy "bum bum bum" vocals are perfect for trolling or just being a nuisance in *Da Hood*. Use this when you want everyone to question their life choices.

### 3. Hopes and Dreams
**ID: 1842823675**
Okay, jokes aside, this song actually slaps hard. It’s emotional, it’s epic, and it makes you feel like the main character of an anime. I use this for obbys or when I'm on a winning streak. It gives you that "I cannot be defeated" energy right before you fall off a cliff. 10/10 vibes.

## How to Stay Determined (And Avoid Glitches)
Don't let technical issues give you a bad time. Here is the sauce on how to use these effectively.
1.  **The "Loud" Trap:** Be careful with IDs labeled "Megalovania." About 50% of them are the normal song, and the other 50% are blown-out, distorted earrape versions that will get you muted by the server admin. Test it in a private server first unless you *want* to be that guy (spoiler: don't be that guy).
2.  **AU Songs act as Backup:** If the original Undertale tracks get taken down by copyright bots, search for "Undertale AU" (Alternate Universe) tracks like "Dusttale" or "Underfell." Fan remixes often survive the ban waves longer than the official OST tracks because the audio fingerprint is different.
3.  **Looping is Key:** Most Undertale tracks are short loops. If you are using a radio, make sure the ID you pick is at least 2 minutes long or properly looped. There is nothing more awkward than "Bonetrousle" cutting out mid-vibe.

## FAQ

**Q: Why does my Megalovania ID play a different song?**
**A:** You got trolled. Sometimes uploaders change the audio file or Roblox reassigns IDs (rarely), but usually, it's a "bait and switch" upload. Just try the next code on the list.

**Q: Can I get banned for playing the "Earrape" version?**
**A:** You won't get banned from Roblox itself unless it contains bad words, but game admins can and will kick you for being annoying. Use your power responsibly, Sans.

**Q: Are these codes free?**
**A:** Using the codes is free if you have a Boombox item in-game. However, most Boomboxes cost Robux. It’s a pay-to-meme world, unfortunately.
