![Top 20 Sad Anime Songs Roblox ID List (2025)](/images/sad-anime-roblox.jpg)

## Introduction
I’ve spent more hours than I care to admit lurking in *Royale High* and *Blox Fruits* chill lobbies, and if there’s one thing that ruins the "main character" vibe, it’s a broken radio. Finding a working **Sad Anime Roblox ID** has become a legitimate chore ever since the 2022 audio purge, leaving most players stuck with generic royalty-free garbage. I’ve personally scrubbed through the current library to verify which emotional bangers are actually still standing in 2025. We’re talking about those specific tracks that make you stare at the digital horizon while you’re grinding levels or just decompressing after a toxic ranked match.

## The Aesthetic of Digital Melancholy
There’s a reason these tracks have a permanent residence on TikTok "core" playlists and aesthetic Roblox edits. Music from shows like *Your Lie in April* or *Tokyo Ghoul* provides a specific atmospheric depth that fast-paced OSTs just can't touch. In the Roblox ecosystem, "sad" isn't just a mood—it's a curated aesthetic. Whether you’re building a moody showcase or just want to signal to the lobby that you’re in your feelings, these songs act as a social shorthand. They turn a mindless grind into a cinematic experience, which is exactly why the community fights so hard to keep re-uploading them every time the copyright hammer drops.

## The Ultimate List: Sad Anime Roblox ID
I’ve compiled the most stable IDs currently available. Note that while these work at the time of writing, the "meta" for Roblox audio is always shifting.

| Song Name | Artist/Source | Roblox ID Code |

| **Unravel (Acoustic)** | Tokyo Ghoul | 8269391552 |
| **Orange (Ending 2)** | Your Lie in April | Orange |
| **Nandemonaiya** | Your Name (Kimi no Na wa) | 1837697591 |

| **Sparkle** | Radwimps | 78232307701371 |

### 1. Guts Theme (Berserk)
This is the gold standard for "contemplative grinding." It’s a low-fidelity masterpiece that fits perfectly in any dark-fantasy RPG or even a simple hangout game. It’s not over-the-top; it just sits in the background and sets a mature tone. I highly recommend this if you're tired of the high-pitched vocals found in most anime OSTs.

### 2. Unravel (Acoustic)
While the original version is a bit too "hype" for a sad list, the acoustic version is pure pain in digital form. It’s a favorite in the *Tokyo Ghoul* RP community for a reason. Use this when you’re standing alone on a roof in a city showcase—it’s peak "edgy protagonist" energy without being too obnoxious about it.

### 3. Orange (Your Lie in April)
If you want to trigger a collective "oof" in the chat, this is the one. It’s incredibly melodic and has a high production value that hasn't been distorted by poor re-uploads. It works best in social spaces where people actually stop to listen to what’s playing on your boombox.

## Managing Your Audio Library: A Troubleshooting Guide
Look, the Roblox audio system is finicky. If a code isn't working, the first thing you need to check is if the audio has been set to "Private" by the creator—there's no workaround for that. Also, keep in mind that many "sad" tracks have very low initial gain. Don't just crank your system volume to 100%, or you'll get blasted when a notification pops up. 

Instead, use the in-game radio settings to boost the track if possible. Another pro tip: avoid pasting codes with spaces at the beginning or end; the Roblox engine is notoriously bad at handling string inputs and will often return an "Invalid ID" error just because of a single rogue space character.

## FAQ

**Q: Why do these codes keep getting deleted?**
**A:** It’s almost always DMCA-related. Roblox’s automated systems scan for copyrighted melodies. When a song gets too popular, it hits the radar and gets nuked. That’s why we update this list regularly to swap in fresh uploads.

**Q: Can I use these in any Roblox game?**
**A:** Only if the game has a "Boombox" or "Radio" feature enabled. Some games also restrict music to their own hand-picked library to avoid copyright strikes against their own experience.

**Q: How do I find the latest working IDs myself?**
**A:** Your best bet is to check the "Recent" tab in the Roblox Creator Marketplace audio section, but be prepared to sift through a lot of "troll" audios and loud noises before finding a gem. Or, just bookmark us. We do the legwork for you.
